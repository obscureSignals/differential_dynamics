# differential_dynamics

Research repo for differentiable dynamic range processing.

Docs
- Analytic dBd notes and final resolution: docs/analytic_dbd_notes.md
- SSL auto-release ground truth and ZOH discretization: docs/ssl_auto_release.md

- Baselines: includes third_party/torchcomp_core (MIT) as a subtree for the classical hard attack/release envelope.
- Contributions: switchable differentiable gating variants (hard, sigmoid, hysteresis, smoothmax, level-dependent-Ï„), benchmarks, and paper code.
