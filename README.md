# differential_dynamics

Research repo for differentiable dynamic range processing.

- Baselines: includes third_party/torchcomp_core (MIT) as a subtree for the classical hard attack/release envelope.
- Contributions: switchable differentiable gating variants (hard, sigmoid, hysteresis, smoothmax, level-dependent-Ï„), benchmarks, and paper code.

Attribution: This project incorporates code from DiffAPF/torchcomp (MIT). See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
